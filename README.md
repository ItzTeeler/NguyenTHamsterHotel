// Description - Website should match AdobeXD to the best as possible.(https://xd.adobe.com/spec/3e3b745f-aa5a-460e-5fd7-8cc90c248d21-480a/specs/) Website should have a section for Rooms, Amenities, Contact, Overview, Reservation, and Packages you could order. The NavBar should relocate you to each sections.

// Desktop website looks identical to the mock-up except for one thing. The reserve button on the Beachside room is slightly higher than the other two buttons. That's the only noticeable difference that I could find. Also, the Navbar in all modes has the same problem, when "Packages" or "Reserve" is pressed nothing happens. For continuity, the rest of the other buttons take you to their respective sections on the website. Besides that, you did an awesome job on the website format and responsiveness. The minimal look on the mobile version is nicely executed.
